A bit is a special node, which provides a mean of interaction to the user.
Currently, here are five kinds of bits. Start bits, end bits, input bits, title bits and task bits.

## Start Bits

The main purpose of a start bit is to be the first bit, which a user interacts
with. There should only be one start bit per flow.

These start bits are currently implemented:

- [Simple](/docs/bits/start-simple)

If you like to contribute a new start bit, you can go to the [contribution guide](/docs/contribution/new-start-bit)

If you like to suggest a new start bit, you can open an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/openpatch/bitflow/issues).

If you like to discuss a new idea for a start bit or you need help, you can visit the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dCMM4kV).

## End Bits

The main purpose of a end bit is to be the last bit, which a user interacts
with. It could show a score or just a goodbye message.

These end bits are currently implemented:

- [Tries](/docs/bits/end-tries)

If you like to contribute a new end bit, you can go to the [contribution guide](/docs/contribution/new-end-bit)

If you like to suggest a new end bit, you can open an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/openpatch/bitflow/issues).

If you like to discuss a new idea for an end bit or you need help, you can visit the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dCMM4kV).

## Input Bits

The main purpose of an input bit is to show a user some kind of content. It
could be a visualization, a video, a picture or a text. This is especially
useful for learning scenarios. For example, you want to show an explanation on
how a for-loop works. Afterwards you would probably use a task bit to check
whether the content was understood or not.

These input bits are currently implemented:

- [Markdown](/docs/bits/input-markdown)

If you like to contribute a new input bit, you can go to the [contribution guide](/docs/contribution/new-input-bit)

If you like to suggest a new input bit, you can open an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/openpatch/bitflow/issues).

If you like to discuss a new idea for an input bit or you need help, you can visit the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dCMM4kV).

## Task Bits

The main purpose of a task bit is to assess the capabilities of a user. The
answer of a user for a given task can be automatically be evaluated. But if your
purpose is not to assess a user or the assessment more advanced, so that it can
not be evaluated automatically, you can disable the automatic evaluation or set
it to manual.

Additionally, to the automatic evaluation of answers, you can also set up
feedback which will be shown to the user when certain criteria are met. These
criteria depend on the task bit.

After an assessment you can also visualize the answer of all users.

You can also capture and replay all interactions of a user with a task (see [capture and replay](/docs/bits/capture-and-replay)).

These task bits are currently implemented:

- [Choice](/docs/bits/task-choice)
- [Fill in the blank](/docs/bits/task-fill-in-the-blank)
- [Input](/docs/bits/task-input)

If you like to contribute a new task bit, you can go to the [contribution guide](/docs/contribution/new-task-bit)

If you like to suggest a new task bit, you can open an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/openpatch/bitflow/issues).

If you like to discuss a new idea for a task bit or you need help, you can visit the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dCMM4kV).

## Title Bits

The main purpose of a title bit is to show information about the flow. For
example the name of the flow or the section which is about to begin.

These title bits are currently implemented:

- [Simple](/docs/bits/title-simple)

If you like to contribute a new title bit, you can go to the [contribution guide](/docs/contribution/new-title-bit)

If you like to suggest a new title bit, you can open an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/openpatch/bitflow/issues).
