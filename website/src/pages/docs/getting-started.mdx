import { Card, CardContent } from "@openpatch/patches";
import { DocLayout } from "../../components/DocLayout";

export const meta = {
  title: "Documentation",
};

## Usage

You can find a minimal example in the [example
folder](https://github.com/openpatch/bitflow/tree/main/examples/nextjs-client-side-assessment)
in the GitHub repository.

export default ({ children }) => (
  <DocLayout meta={meta}>
    <Card>
      <CardContent>{children}</CardContent>
    </Card>
  </DocLayout>
);

If you also want to show the Flow or want to use the Flow-Editor use have to
install additional packages. For this visit the [flow documentation](/docs/flow).
