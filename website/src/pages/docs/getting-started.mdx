import { Card, CardContent } from "@openpatch/patches";
import { DocLayout } from "../../components/DocLayout";

export const meta = {
  title: "Documentation",
};

## Terminology

Flow-based assessments with Bitflow consits of a [Flow](/docs/flow). A [Flow](/docs/flow) definies the logic of your
assessment. A Flow is defined by nodes and edges. A edge just connects two nodes. A node can either be an interactive
one or a control one. Interactive meaning requiring interaction by the user and control meaning working in the
background without the user knowing that they are there. You can read more about [Flows here](/docs/flow).

You can use the [Do](/docs/do) component for executing a [Flow](/docs/flow) and the [Report](/docs/report) components
for showing the results.


## Installation

At minimum you need to install `@biflow/provider`, one start bit e.g. `@bitflow/start-simple`, one end bit e.g.
`@bitflow/end-tries`. Of course you also want to have some tasks bits e.g. `@bitflow/task-choice`. See
[Bits](/docs/bits) for more details on the different bits you can install.

## Usage

A minimal example using the [DoLocal](/docs/do-local) would look like this:

```tsx
import { PatchesProvider } from "@openpatch/patches";
import { BitflowProvider } from "@bitflow/provider";
import * as startSimple from "@bitflow/start-simple";
import * as endTries from "@bitflow/end-tries";
import * taskChoice from "@bitflow/task-choice";
import { DoLocal } from "@bitflow/do-local";

export default () => {
  return (
    <PatchesProvider>
      <BitflowProvider
        config={{}}
        bits={{
          end: {
            tries: endTries
          },
          start: {
            simple: startSimple
          },
          input: {},
          task: {
            choice: taskChoice
          },
          title: {}
        }}
      >
        <DoLocal flow={...} />
      </BitflowProvider>
    </PatchesProvider>
  )
}
```

If you want to evaluate and store the answers on your server you need to do a little more by using the [Do](/docs/do)
component.

## Example

You can find a minimal example in the [example
folder](https://github.com/openpatch/bitflow/tree/main/examples/nextjs-client-side-assessment)
in the GitHub repository.

export default ({ children }) => (
  <DocLayout meta={meta}>
    <Card>
      <CardContent>{children}</CardContent>
    </Card>
  </DocLayout>
);

If you also want to show the Flow or want to use the Flow-Editor use have to
install additional packages. For this visit the [flow documentation](/docs/flow).
