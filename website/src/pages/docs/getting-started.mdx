import { Card, CardContent } from "@openpatch/patches";
import { DocLayout } from "../../components/DocLayout";

export const meta = {
  title: "Documentation",
};

Before you can start to create and conduct flow-based assessment with Bitflow
you need to install the required packages and set it up.

## Installation

To install a minimal setup of Bitflow you need to run this command:

npm:

```shell
npm install @bitflow/provider @bitflow/engine @bitflow/do @bitflow/start-simple @bitflow/end-tries @bitflow/task-choice
```

yarn:

```shell
yarn add @bitflow/provider @bitflow/engine @bitflow/do @bitflow/start-simple @bitflow/end-tries @bitflow/task-choice
```

If you also want to show the Flow or want to use the Flow-Editor use have to
install additional packages. For this visit the [flow documentation](/docs/flow).

## Usage

You can find a minimal example in the [example
folder](https://github.com/openpatch/bitflow/tree/develop/examples/nextjs-client-side-assessment)
in the GitHub repository.

export default ({ children }) => (
  <DocLayout meta={meta}>
    <Card>
      <CardContent>{children}</CardContent>
    </Card>
  </DocLayout>
);
