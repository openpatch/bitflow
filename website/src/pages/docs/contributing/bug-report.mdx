For bug reporting you can go to https://github.com/openpatch/bitflow/issues/new
and describe that you have encountered. It is easier to fix the bug, you also
provide information on what did you expect to happen. If this bug is present in an
open source project, please leave a link to the source code. Pictures, Gifs or
videos are also welcome.
