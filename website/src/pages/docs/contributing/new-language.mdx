export const meta = {
  title: "New Language",
};

To add a new language, you need to modify the `vocab.config.js` file of each
package by adding an entry to the languages list. Lets assume that you added
French `fr`. Afterwards you need to add a `fr.translations.json` file to the
`locales.vocab` folder. This file you have the same structure as the
`translations.json` file. Then you can generate the new locales by running `yarn build:locale`. Now everything should be ready.

export default ({ children }) => (
  <DocLayout meta={meta}>
    <Card>
      <CardContent>{children}</CardContent>
    </Card>
  </DocLayout>
);
